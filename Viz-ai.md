> Conclusion: Hospital utilization of an AI-based care coordination platform was associated with a significant decrease of 39.5 minutes in the time to NIR contact, increase in patients taken for intervention, and lower DTN times for thrombolytics.
> Context: “In the world of stroke treatment, the saying ‘time is brain’ comes from the fact that when brain tissue is deprived of oxygenated blood, approximately two million neurons die every minute”

- Improve current processes by automating routine medical imaging tasks, (faster diagnosis and treatment). It integrates smoothly with hospital systems

## Risk

- **High Cost**: The platform's pricing can be a barrier, especially for smaller hospitals and clinics with limited budgets. 

- Steep learning curve

- Limited currently to a handful of conditions

- Ethical Concerns: vast amounts of medical data, questions arise about the ethical use of this information, particularly as it could give them a significant competitive advantage​ [The Healthcare Blog](https://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2020/09/24/its-complicated-a-deep-dive-into-the-viz-medicare-ai-reimbursement-model/) 

## Tangible Benefit

- Patient outcomes

- Save staff time thanks to automation

## Conclusion

Overall, Viz.ai is highly effective for large hospitals needing rapid disease detection and care coordination, but its cost and specialized focus can be limitations for smaller or less AI-advanced facilities.
