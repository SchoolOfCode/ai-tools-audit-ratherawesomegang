### Zebra Medical Vision

- **Benefits**:
  - Real-time, AI-driven diagnostics for radiology departments.
  - Reduces diagnostic errors and improves speed in identifying medical conditions like cancer.

  ### Why it’s Best for a Medical Company:


	**Cost Effective** Zebra Medical Vision offers a per-scan pricing model, making it a highly cost-effective solution for hospitals and diagnostic centres that deal with large volumes of imaging (e.g., X-rays, CT scans, MRIs).


	**Immidiate Impact**
     The tool provides real-time analysis of medical images, helping radiologists and clinicians detect abnormalities quickly, improving patient outcomes and speeding up diagnosis times.

	**Scalability**
     It’s affordable for both small and large institutions because you only pay for what you use, and it easily scales with the size of the medical practice or hospital.

	**Proven Use in Healthcare:**	 Focused specifically on medical imaging, it’s trusted by radiology departments worldwide, and it supports common and critical diagnostic tasks.

     - **Cost Estimate**:
	•	Annual Cost: £40,000 to £250,000 depending on scan volume.
  
    - **Risks**:
    - False positives/negatives could lead to misdiagnoses.
    - High data dependency: relies on the quality of input medical images.


    
if I had to chose a second pairing : 

 **Synk Ai** :
 (for Security and Compliance)

Why It’s a Great Pairing:

	•	Focus on Security: Snyk AI specializes in identifying security vulnerabilities in codebases, ensuring that medical companies maintain compliance with stringent regulations like HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).
	•	Proactive Threat Detection: It helps developers secure applications by integrating security checks early in the development cycle, preventing vulnerabilities from being pushed into production environments.
	•	Compliance Support: For a medical company, securing patient data and ensuring compliance with healthcare regulations is crucial. Snyk AI helps manage open-source software risks and ensures that development teams maintain compliance with healthcare regulations.

Pros of Snyk AI for Medical Companies:

	•	Continuous Security Monitoring: Medical companies can track vulnerabilities and security issues throughout their software stack.
	•	Real-Time Alerts: Immediate notifications about security risks help ensure that patient data and internal systems remain secure.
	•	Automated Fixes: Snyk can automatically recommend security patches for detected vulnerabilities, streamlining the remediation process.

### Snyk AI

- **Benefits**:
  - Ensures the security of healthcare applications and compliance with HIPAA and GDPR.
  - Automated vulnerability detection and real-time security alerts.
  - Easy integration into existing DevOps workflows.

- **Risks**:
  - Potential for false positives, which could increase the workload for developers.

- **Cost Estimate**:
  - £20,000 to £100,000 annually, depending on the size of the company and the complexity of the software projects.



## Recommendations
- **Zebra Medical Vision** is recommended for radiology departments looking for cost-effective, AI-powered diagnostics with scalable​
