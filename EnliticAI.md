## Evaluating Enlitic AI

# Opportunity

What problems does this tool solve?

- Enlitic’s solutions, such as ENDEX™ and ENCOG™, streamline medical imaging data by standardising and integrating it across systems. This automation enhances research efficiency, reduces manual data preparation, and ensures that the data remains high-quality and clinically relevant, leading to more accurate and reliable research findings.

How can it improve current processes?

- Streamlined Data Management: By standardising and integrating medical imaging data across different systems, Enlitic’s solutions enhance consistency and interoperability. This reduces manual efforts and errors, leading to more efficient data handling.
- Accelerated Research: Automation of data organisation and standardisation reduces the time and effort needed for data preparation, allowing researchers to focus more on analysis and generating insights, thus speeding up the research process.
- Enhanced Data Quality: Enlitic ensures that the data used in research is high-quality and clinically relevant. This improves the accuracy and reliability of research findings, supporting more effective and actionable outcomes.

# Risk

- Data security: Enlitic’s solutions require handling and processing sensitive medical imaging data. There is a risk of data breaches or unauthorised access if security measures are not robust. Ensuring that data is protected throughout the process is crucial.
- Compliance concerns: Compliance with healthcare regulations is essential. Any failure to adhere to these regulations could lead to legal issues and affect the credibility of the solution.
- Integration challenges: There could be difficulties in integrating Enlitic’s solutions with existing systems. Poor integration might disrupt current workflows or create additional complexity.

# Tangible Benefit

- Potential cost savings: Automation reduces the need for manual data handling and administrative tasks, potentially lowering operational costs. Savings also come from increased efficiency and fewer errors that might require costly corrections.
- Time efficiency: Enlitic’s solutions accelerate the research and diagnostic processes. This leads to faster data preparation and quicker insights, saving valuable time for researchers and radiologists.
- Productivity improvement: Enlitic’s tools enhance productivity by reducing manual tasks and allowing staff to focus on higher-value activities, such as detailed analysis and patient care. Improved data management also supports better decision-making and streamlined workflows.

# Evaluation

Does the benefit outweigh the risk?

- The benefits of Enlitic’s solutions, including streamlined data management, accelerated research, and enhanced data quality, are significant. However, potential risks related to data security and compliance must be carefully managed. If the company can implement robust security measures and ensure regulatory compliance, the benefits likely outweigh the risks.

Would you recommend adoption?

- Given the improvements in efficiency, data quality, and productivity, Enlitic’s solutions appear valuable for enhancing medical imaging processes. If effective risk mitigation strategies are in place, adoption of Enlitic’s solutions is recommended for organisations seeking to improve their data handling and research capabilities.
